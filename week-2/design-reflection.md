What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?
Information Gathering, Planning, Design, Development, Testing and Delivery, Maintenance

What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?
The primary goal of my site is as a professional site to present to potential employers my background, skills, and strengths.

What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?
My target audience's interests are to find someone with both skills and capacity to fill their development needs.  They will also want someone who has drive and the ability to learn quickly.  I will be able to post examples of projects I have completed or am working on.  By linking to my blog, they will be able to see my thinking process and evolution in my learning.  By including my background, I will show potential other non-technical skills that transfer to the needs of companies.

What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.
I want them to check out my portfolio/projects, find out why I stand out above others, and to contact me for an interview.

What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?
It is much more complex than one might think.  The user experience (UX) is really vital to consider.  This incorporates how the user feels when viewing the site, beyond just the usability and functionality of the site.  A designer must consider who the target audience is and what kind of look and feel they want.  They should be consulted throughout the design process to make sure they are getting what they want.

What is user experience design and why is it valuable? 
User experience design is design that is centered around how the user feels when interacting with a system.  This often involves considerable research.  For example, it would be valuable for someone to be able to easily find the information they are looking for v. getting frustrated because s/he is not.  A vendor wants to make it easy to get to the checkout and make purchases.  Even the color of buttons can affect the user's experience.  UX design also incorporates accessibility for people who may use a screen-reader, people with older devices or slow internet connections.    It's valuable to use UX design to improve the user experience to increase revenue and to create return visitors.

Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?
The tedious part for me was trying to figure out how to get a file from either the web or a download on my computer (my site map) to my virtual machine.  I also don't know what the importance of file extensions are and what kind of extension to put on a url link.
