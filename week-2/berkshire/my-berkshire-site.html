<!--
What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
It was really satisfying to make it work.
- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements? 
I didn't have to research.  I had just done the basic sections of Codeacademy, so it was fresh.
- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)  
I don't know how to format, so it was easy to stay with best practices
- What seems good and bad about HTML?
It seems good because it is simple.  It's bad because it can be time-consuming to write all the tags.
- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
My tricks are to write in both the opening and closing tags so that I don't forget and so that I don't have to spend time figuring out where they go.
