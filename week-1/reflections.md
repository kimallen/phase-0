#1.1 Think About Time Reflection
I'm excited to try the Fogg method of creating habits.  I've already started trying to use it for myself in doing self-care activities.  I plan to use it for self-care during DBC.  I'm also drawn to the Pomodoro method, (despite the gimmicky presentation of it).  Combining that with time box I know is helpful for me.  Space abhors a vacuum, and I do too, apparently, so I know I tend to take the amount of time I have to accomplish something.  I know that it is helpful to set timers for myself; it helps me to stay focused, on-task, and work more efficiently.  In fact, I am timing myself right now.  There are times when I am very efficient with my time, and that usually happens when I have a lot of structured embedded into my day.  By creating structure through time boxes, I will be more efficient.  I plan to utilize this during Phase 0 in addition to scheduling other activities to create structure, as I am mostly not working right now.

#1.2 The Command Line Reflection
What is a shell? What is "bash?" A shell is the place where basic command lines can be entered.  Bash is the Unix program for entering command lines.
What was the most challenging for you in going through this material? The most challenging was when the course would give an example of something but not explain it.  For example, I still don't fully understand popd and pushd.  I also found that getting help with "man" didn't work for me nor did several other versions I looked up.  I also had trouble copying something from one branch to another branch (they were not files embedded in the same path as others).
Were you able to successfully use all of the commands?  I got through all of the regular commands, but for some of the "Do More" sections, I was unsure of how to proceed.  One was when we were asked to change our PATH.  
In your opinion, what are the most important commands and arguments to know? cd, ls, grep, cat and less (and q to quit paging), pwd
Can you remember what each of the following does of the top of your head? Write what each does.
 

 

-ls lists

-mv moves a document

-cd changes directory

-../ goes up a level in a directory

-touch creates empty file

-mkdir creates a new directory

-less allows paging through the contents of a file

-rmdir removes a directory

-rm removes a document

-help goes to a list ways to use a specific command

#1.4 Forking and Cloning Reflection
Instructions on. . .

Creating a Repo:

1) go to your GitHub profile page.

2)In the top right, there is a '+' symbol.  Click on this and then click on "New Repository"

3) Next you should see a new page with your "username/" and a textbox entitled "Repository name"

    a) Enter the name of your new repository there.

    b) select public

    c) add a license: choose "MIT License"

    d) Click "Create Repository"

4) you should see your new repository listed on on your profile page under the Repositories tab.

Fork a repo:
1) Go to the repository page on Github you want to fork.
2) Click on "fork" in the upper right corner.
3) Click on the place where you want to fork it to (make sure your github account is open)
4) that's it- you should see it on your page

Clone a repo:
1) after forking to your account, open your shell.
2) go to the directory where you want to put it.

3) on your GitHub account, copy the url in the lower right side of the screen
4) enter "git clone URL-YOU-JUST-COPIED"
5) enter ls to see if it is now in your computer's directory

I would fork a repository because I want to use a copy of the one I am forking from. If I create a new repository, it will be empty.

Setting up git was entangled in setting up my virtual machine, and that whole mess took three days, so I'm not sure which part involved installing git, but overall it was challenging because I didn't know the next steps and had to seek help several times. Github basically just involved registering an account.
