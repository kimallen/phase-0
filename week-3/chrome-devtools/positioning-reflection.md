How can you use Chrome's DevTools inspector to help you format or position elements?
I can use it the same way I did in this exercise.  I can easily see the changes as I make them to see if they have the desired affect.

How can you resize elements on the DOM using CSS?
I can resize them by changing the height and width to the number of px or ems that I want.

What are the differences between Absolute, Fixed, Static, and Relative positioning? 
Static- this is the default position.  It is where the element lands in the document without telling it where to go.
Absolute- this positions in relation to the element's nearest parent, unless the parent has static positioning, in which case it will be positioned in relation to the whole html document.
Fixed- A fixed element is like placing it like a sticky note on the screen- it stays put even when you scroll and other elements move.
Relative- This positions the element in relation to where it would be if static.  So, if without relative positioning it lands 10 pixels from the top and the left and you told it to increase the margin by 5, it would then be 15 from the top and left side.

Which did you find easiest to use? Which was most difficult?
Static is confusing because you never really know where it's going to land in relation to other elements.  I find the names confusing- static and fixed have similar semantics, but are very different in function.  I find fixed easy to use because once it is placed, that is where it stays.  Absolute is confusing because it changes depending on where the closest ancestor is.

What are the differences between Margin, Border, and Padding?
Margin- the space given between the edge of the element and other elements of the edge of the page.
Border- this is the edge of the element
Padding- this is the space between the border of the element and the content of the element.
What was your impression of this challenge overall? (love, hate, and why?)
I certainly didn't love it, largely because it was time consuming.  It will be helpful for me to just play around with the different positioning values to see what happens.  It's harder to do this in a pair.  It was challenging to understand what was going to happen without looking up each definition each time for the position.  I can see how it could be a fun challenge with more practice and background.  It was most frustrating when we checked everything and it still didn't seem to be doing what we wanted.
