		<article>The idea is pretty simple. Git is basically a way that you can save different drafts of things and easily go back to the different versions. Imagine you are writing a story. You want to change a paragraph, but are concerned your new paragraph is going to make less sense than the first. So, you save the old version and the new version in your word processor. Rather than saving multiple documents, git organizes your different versions and allows you to go back to old onces if you choose.</article>

	<aside>I best understand the steps to utilizing git and GitHub by making cute drawings of clouds and computer monitors and drawing flow arrows. But I can't pretend to share my technical know-how by showing you some digital drawing. Maybe one day I'll post a photo of my handdrawn clouds and arrows.</aside>

<!--What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?
I used <main> and <article> tags in additional to the ones that will be on every page.  It seems that there will always be a main area as well as a header and footer, so these will bet used the most often.  Other tags would get used less often because they are less essential and not found on every page, such as <aside>

How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?
I believe that elements get laid out as they are listed in the order in the html document.  If it is a header or footer, it will be first or last. CSS determines where the elements are placed on the page.
What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?
I learned that Sublime tries to make it easy to use and reduce the amount of duplication in typing.  For example, the ability to create a snippet keeps you from having to create the same set of tags repeatedly.  Knowing that I can do this, if I find myself creating similar templates either in html or other languages, I can create one.  It would be a great idea to see what shortcuts are already there so that I don't reinvent the wheel.   I also learned that if you create a snippet with a trigger that already exists, it will just create a second one with the same name, so it's important not to use an existing snippet trigger for a new one you want to create.
