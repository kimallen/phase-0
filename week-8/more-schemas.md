What is a one-to-one database?
One in which there is only one of an item, but there may be more information to share about it and it is one that could have a nill value.
When would you use a one-to-one database? (Think generally, not in terms of the example you created).
When I wanted to pull out details that may not be needed as often so that the main table can be smaller.  Also when an item could turn out nill in the main table.
What is a many-to-many database?
When a table A can have many of table B, and vice versa.
When would you use a many-to-many database? (Think generally, not in terms of the example you created).
When there's many of both things in the tables represented.
What is confusing about database schemas? What makes sense?
one to one is confusing.  it's also confusing which data table to assign a primary key to and which to assign the foreign key.
